  <description>
  ENCHAIN links snappy platforming and hack + slash juggling with fast-paced retro FPS gunplay.
  Inspired by the competitive fighting genre and Quake, combo and smash the undead into pieces with your lantern hook and punchy arsenal of guns.
  And, with progression and verticality influenced by Metroidvanias and Dark Souls, tackle a single interconnected world chunk by chunk, retreading old paths and secrets.
  
  You are the last corpse that will ever rise from the stone depths, dooming all creation to a ceaseless death.
  This underworld does not welcome you. Unlock the secrets of the crypt, take back life from your fleshless brethren, and fight your own way out of humanity's tomb.

  <history>This solo project started in late 2017 as a Ludum Dare 40 entry, created in 72 hours. Theme: "The more you have, the worse it is."
  The concept in this first rough prototype was a simple, retro inspired FPS with a main grapple hook mechanic and a “burden” mechanic that treated enemies as the keys to doors.
  After about three months of working on this jam game, developer mattlawr (Matthew Lawrence) decided to rework the game as their next big project.
  A lot has changed in the years since then, with tons of iteration and shifts in the development. A major barrier to development from 2019-2023 been that mattlawr was focusing attention on university.
