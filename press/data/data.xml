  <description>
	My name is Matthew Lawrence and I make games, videos, and other media.
	My main project is Enchain, a small, experimental first person shooter which I develop alone.

  <history>
	  I am currently a student majoring in Computer Science.
	  Before college, I would spend my time absorbing YouTube videos about Unity and Blender, slowly picking up on the process of game development.
	  I often joined the Ludum Dare game jam, trying out various genres and some overambitious ideas.
	  At first I wasnâ€™t familiar with programming at all, but that changed when I took on a larger project where I could Google search away at small problems every day, building a little multiplayer FPS game called Bionic.
	  That journey taught me so much about programming and Blender that I was comfortable making most of my game content on my own.
	  Since then, I have continued to join game jams every now and then, but mostly working on Enchain.
